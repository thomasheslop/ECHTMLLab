Hello! 

We are going to start making your own webpages using the
languages of HTML and CSS. For now, we're going to focus on
a webpage that shows the major schools in the DC area. 

There are five containers for the following schools:
Howard University (HU), American University (AU), Georgetown
University (GT), George Washington University (GWU). 

1. Create a text tag that says the name of each of the schools

2. Add a background color to each container with the school
name

3. Insert a picture of each school 
**hint** you can download
         the images or just use the url

**BONUS** Search how you can change the name of webpage
in the address bar (EX: google.com/buttercups)

**BONUS** Add the school logo next to the name of the school

**BONUS** Search up how to use grid rows and divide your page
into grids and columns. 

**BONUS** Google what flex box is! Use flex box to align your 
items into their sections more appropriately
